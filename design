-- Create room or join room page
-- 
-- Join a room using a room code
-- (set up websockets somehow idk)
-- 
-- Start game, everyone gets a prompt input box

-- Ok so here's the general idea for the first iteration:

-- Put in your name and your game code

-- Input prompt thing with submit button
-- -> If last round (round number == num_players) then render compare page
-- -> Show round number (start at 0)
-- -> Show image to describe (if applicable)
-- -> Check that working is not true (importnat!!)
-- -> Clear image queue
-- -> Takes you to check status page
-- -> Puts your prompt in the queue
-- -> Asynchronous worker do dad processes things in the queue sequentially (idk something should probably work)

-- Check status page
-- -> if everyone is ready already then go to next round
-- -> Searches the dir for pictures that are being generated, adds them to the image_queue
-- -> Each image has a choose button
-- -> button to go back to input prompt page to replace current prompt
-- -> refresh button

-- Compare page
-- -> Show images from each round grouped by player

-- TODO: Make sure that there can be multiple images per turn and one selected or something (gen 10 at a time or something)
